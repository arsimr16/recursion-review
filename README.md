# recursion-review
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).  This project was worked on with a pair.

For this sprint I practiced recursion by reimplementing parts of the browser that involve recursion (obviously without using the things I was reimplementing or any other built-in shortcuts).

I reimplemented the following functions:
* getElementsByClassName
* stringify JSON
* parse JSON

I also fixed broken tests to become more familiar with [Mocha](https://mochajs.org) and [Chai](http://chaijs.com).
